I'm Rui Feng, a PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology. 
Currently, I'm working on machine learning and natural langauge processing with Prof Chao Zhang.
Our aim is to build intelligent systems capable of logical reasoning, improving the efficiency, 
interpretability, and robustness of machine learning algorithms. Prior to Georgia Tech, I was a 
member of Prof Yang's lab at Zhejiang University, where I studied graph-related algorithms.

Task-aware Embedding by Leveraging Structural Similarity and Vertex Connectivity  
--------
Research Assistant, Digital Media Computing & Design Lab, Zhejiang University	Mar 2018 - July 2019 

 - Proposed two network embedding algorithms utilizing hard margin penalization and probabilistic modeling to infer vertices’ labels while leveraging different similarity measures. 
 - Improved network semi-supervised learning efficiency over state-of-arts on PPDai’s user network by 3% to 10%. 
  

Representation Learning for Scale-free Networks  
-------
Research Assistant, Digital Media Computing & Design Lab, Zhejiang University	   Apr 2017 - Nov 2017 

 - Theoretically analyzed the feasibility of embedding scale-free networks onto Euclidean space using tools of the sphere packing analysis. 
 - Proposed degree-punishment principle to optimize the embedding efficiency of scale-free networks in terms of the ability to preserve the scale-free property. 
 - Significantly improved efficiency of representation vectors by 10%-20% both in terms of scale-free property and in various real-world social network mining tasks. 


Non-discriminative Representation Learning 
------ 
Research Assistant, Digital Media Computing & Design Lab, Zhejiang University      Mar 2017 – July 2018

- Studied the problem of de-biasing historical discrimination in data sets when applying machine learning algorithms by mapping attributes to a latent feature. 
- Effectively blocked sensitive information and improved decision-making process. Provided theoretical guarantees for individual fairness and statistical parity.
