I'm Rui Feng, a PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology. 
Currently, I'm working on machine learning and natural langauge processing with Prof Chao Zhang.
Our aim is to build intelligent systems capable of logical reasoning, improving the efficiency, 
interpretability, and robustness of machine learning algorithms. Prior to Georgia Tech, I was a 
member of Prof Yang's lab at Zhejiang University, where I studied graph-related algorithms.
